# Awesome Inclusivity

The intent of this list is to provide guidelines for writing great, clear, concise, and **inclusive** documentation. This idea came from a discussion in the hangops #allies channel as I sought feedback on removing the term "master" from policy documentation. The number resources provided made it clear that creating a list for this topic would benefit the community.

If you would like to learn more about general diversity topics please check the [Awesome Diversity](https://github.com/folkswhocode/awesome-diversity) list, which contains a great list of curated articles, websites, and resources about diversity in technology.

This will always be a work in progress so feedback, suggestions, and pull requests are welcome.
