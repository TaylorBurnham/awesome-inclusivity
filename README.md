# Awesome Inclusivity

Possibly the start of something wonderful, and also a potential duplication of effort that the [Awesome Diversity](https://github.com/folkswhocode/awesome-diversity) repo is up to. 

This idea came from a discussion in the hangops #allies channel as I sought feedback on removing the term "master" from policy documentation. The intent of this list is to provide guidelines for writing clear, concise, and **inclusive** documentation.

This is a work in progress so feedback, suggestions, and pull requests are welcome.
